The file structure should be like:

1. unimodal_label --> y1 and y2 unimodal label collection
2. image_caption_generation --> project vision information into text
3. dataset_splitting --> split dataset into multiple parts
4. expert_model_training --> train the model based on multiple components
5. expert_model_inference --> check the inference part of the dataset
